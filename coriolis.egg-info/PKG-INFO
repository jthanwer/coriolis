Description: # Coriolis
        
        ## What is it ?
        Coriolis is a quick visualization software developped using PyQt5 and xarray. 
        It allows the user to get a quick insight of a NetCDF file.
        
        It provides 4-D field main statistics, an embedded matplotlib canvas 
        to visualize the data you choose to plot and some features to save
        the figure, scale the data, change the colorbar, use non-linear axis scales, ...
        
        An animation widget is implemented. However, at this point, matplotlib is not fast enough to enable a 
        confortable quickly refreshing plots. Other software such as NcView should be used instead.
        
        More importantly, Coriolis allows the user to precisely select the data to plot.
        1-D and 2-D plots are possible.
        
        ## How to install it ?
        
        A simple 
        
        conda install coriolis 
        
        is normally sufficient to install the package.
        
        You can then use the package by running your terminal
        and using this command :
        
        corio yourfile.nc
        
        ## How to customize it ?
        
        You want to customize the figures you're plotting the same way matplotlib
        allows you to do it ?
        
        You can modify the file custom.mplstyle and change the settings.
